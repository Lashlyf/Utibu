        <h1>Male Anatomy Explained\n</h1>
    <p>It’s a common myth that men think about sex every seven seconds.
        However, a study conducted at Ohio State University suggests the real number is likely closer to 19 times a day.
        Regardless of the figure, you can guarantee most of those thoughts concern getting busy between the sheets, and not what happens in the body.
        A lot of men have no idea how wonderfully complex their anatomy actually is, but I’m here to offer some insights.\n
    </p><br/>
        <h2>PENIS: MAN’S BEST FRIEND\n</h2><br/>
    <p>The penis is the part of the reproductive system men are most familiar with because it’s the organ used in sexual intercourse and masturbation.
        It actually has three parts: the root, the body, and the glans penis or head.
        The root attaches to the abdominal wall.
        The body’s three chambers fill with blood to cause an erection.
        If blood flow is compromised, erectile dysfunction occurs.
        The glans penis has a high concentration of nerve endings which makes sex pleasurable.\n</p><br/>
        <h2>SCROTUM: HOLDS TESTES AND REGULATES TEMPERATURE\n</h2><br/>
    <p>The scrotum is a sack of skin and muscles that houses the testes.
        The scrotum helps keep the testes away from the body, so they’re cool for optimal sperm development\n.</p><br/>
        <h2>TESTES: SPERM AND TESTOSTERONE PRODUCERS\n</h2><br/>
        <p>The testes are two glands which produce sperm and testosterone.
        If the testes don’t work effectively, you may have a low sperm count and low testosterone levels.
            While the terms testicles and testes are often used interchangeably, the testicles are actually the testes and their surrounding structures.\n</p><br/>
    <p>After the testes make sperm, the sperm travels to the epididymis to grow.
        During sexual arousal, contractions send the mature sperm on their way.
        An epididymal obstruction can sometimes form, causing infertility, but this can be diagnosed and effectively treated.\n</p><br/>
        <h2>VAS DEFERENS AND SEMINAL VESICLES: AID EJACULATION\n</h2><br/>
    <p>Together the vas deferens and seminal vesicles form the ejaculatory duct.
        Sperm from the epididymis reaches the vas deferens, then travels to the seminal vesicles where it joins with fluids to become semen.
        During ejaculation, muscles surrounding the seminal vesicles expel the semen.
        Up to 30% of men can experience premature ejaculation, while many men, particularly as they age, may experience delayed ejaculation.\n</p><br/>
        <h2>PROSTATE GLAND: MAKES PROSTATIC FLUID\n</h2><br/>
    <p>The prostate produces prostatic fluid. This white fluid nourishes, protects, and supports sperm, and is the major component in semen.\n</p><br/>
    <h2>URETHRA: EMPTIES BODILY FLUID\n</h2><br/>
    <p>The urethra is the final stop before sperm leaves the body during an orgasm.
        This tube works double-duty, also carrying urine from the bladder.
        During an erection, urine flow is blocked to ensure only semen leaves the body during an orgasm.\n</p><br/>
    <p><i>The next time you think about sex, remember all the complex parts of your body that are involved in the process.
    Such an amazing system should never be taken for granted.\n</i></p><br/></string>

    <string name="Safe_sex">Safer sex practices often involve using barriers in your body to help prevent you and your partner from sharing bodily fluids.
        Some of these barrier methods include:external condoms,internal condoms,dental dams,gloves.
        These methods have been shown to be effective at preventing STIs, which are transmitted through bodily fluids such as:semen,blood,vaginal secretions,saliva.
        Barrier methods can help protect you and your partner from STIs such as:HIV,gonorrhea,chlamydia,trichomoniasis,hepatitis A, B, and C.
        Barrier methods are less effective at preventing STIs that are transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, but they can still help reduce your risk.\n
        When selecting barrier methods, opt for latex or polyurethane condoms and dental dams. And always use them during any kind of sexual contact or penetration to protect you and your partner.
        According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HPV causes about 70 percentTrusted Source of cancers of the oropharynx (back of the throat near the base of the tongue and tonsils) in the United States.
        This year, according to the American Cancer Society, slightly more than 54,000 peopleTrusted Source will be diagnosed with oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer in the United States.
        Research also shows that there’s been a steady increase in the number of oropharyngeal cancer diagnoses caused by an HPV infection.
        HPV is not known to cause other mouth and throat cancers in areas such as the mouth, salivary glands, larynx (voice box), lip, or nose.\n
        Prevent HIV with PrEP\n
        PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a prescription medication that’s designed to help prevent contracting HIV during sex without a barrier method or when sharing needles. It’s taken before possible HIV exposure.
        The most common PrEP pills are available under the brand names Truvada and Descovy.</string>
